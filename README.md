# HelloWork

## Problem Statement

We are told that hiring is about people. About attitude. About integrity. Yet every day, we defer judgment to algorithms that parse résumés for keywords, overlook nuance, and mistake formatting for character. Employers claim to seek potential, but filter for sameness. And in doing so, we lose something vital.

The tools we’ve built to find the best in us now filter out the very humanity they were meant to elevate. This isn’t just inefficient — it’s unjust. We have automated the dehumanization of workers, obscuring the soul behind the skill. The irony is stark: in a world more connected than ever, people have never felt more unseen.

If we are serious about merit, opportunity, and fairness, then we must build systems that recognize not just what a person has done, but who they are — and who they could become. The moral landscape of work demands it. Anything less is not only a failure of imagination, but of courage.

## Mission Statement

Connecting people and opportunity with character and skill.

## Vision Statement

When skill is commoditized, and character defines our true wealth, HelloWork seeks to amplify the human qualities that make us who we are—not just what we do. We’re more than engineers, plumbers, or janitors—we are us. In a world driven by algorithms, none exist to measure kindness, grit, or integrity. HelloWork exists to change that—to connect good people with great opportunities.
